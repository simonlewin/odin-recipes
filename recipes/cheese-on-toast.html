    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is such a great brunch option and a nice way to use any tomatoes lying around in your fridge! Cheesy buttery brunch, whats not to love?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 Slices of White Bread</li>
      <li>125g Medium Cheddar</li>
      <li>125g Red Leicester</li>
      <li>2 Garlic Cloves</li>
      <li>1 Tsp Kashmiri Chilli Powder</li>
      <li>500g Cherry Tomatoes</li>
      <li>60g Anchor Butter (Plus Extra For Buttering Bread)</li>
      <li>Handful of Parsley</li>
      <li>Chilli Flakes (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start by buttering one side of each slice of your bread and setting them aside. Get a large pan up to a medium heat and then toast the bread, butter side-down, until deep golden brown. Do this in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
      <li>Grate the cheese, then mix and load onto the untoasted side of the bread, season with black pepper and set aside ready for grilling.</li>
      <li>Halve the tomatoes and set aside.</li>
      <li>Next, take the same pan you toasted the bread in and heat up 2 tbsp of olive oil. Mince your garlic before adding it to the pan and gently frying. After a minute or so, add the chilli powder and cook for a further 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Add the tomatoes and toss to coat in the chilli powder and garlic.</li>
      <li>Season with salt and pepper and allow to cook for 10 mins.</li>
      <li>At this point, turn on your grill and allow it to come up to temperature.</li>
      <li>Once the tomatoes have cooked down, reduce the pan to a low heat. Cube the cold butter and start to add a little at a time, whisking gently to emulsify.</li>
      <li>Once you have used all the butter, stir through a handful of chopped parsley and take off the heat. Check the seasoning and adjust if necessary.</li>
      <li>Place the bread under the grill for a couple of minutes to allow the cheese to melt then serve with the buttery tomatoes on top.</li>
      <li>For an extra kick, finish the dish with a sprinkling of chilli flakes. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
